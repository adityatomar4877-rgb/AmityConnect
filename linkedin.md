# 🚀 Excited to share my latest project: CampusFlow!

I'm thrilled to announce the completion of **CampusFlow**, a project built during the **HackOverflow** hackathon organized by the **Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Goa**.

**CampusFlow** is a hyper-local, community-driven platform designed to revolutionize safety and mobility within university campuses. 

### 🌟 Key Features:
- **🚨 Real-time Emergency SOS**: A robust safety system with live location tracking and proximity-based faculty response (verified within 500m).
- **🚗 Smart Ride-Sharing**: A community-driven carpooling system to optimize campus commutes with route-based matching.
- **🛒 Errands Marketplace**: A peer-to-peer help system where students can request or offer help with campus tasks.
- **🏆 Gamification**: Interactive badges and streaks to encourage positive community participation and safety.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/UI
- **Backend/Database**: Firebase Firestore (Real-time syncing)
- **Auth**: Firebase Auth (Google Sign-In)
- **Maps**: Leaflet for real-time location visualization
- **Interactions**: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions

### 💡 The Problem & Solution:
Campus safety and mobility are often fragmented. **CampusFlow** solves this by unifying emergency response, commuting, and peer-to-peer assistance into a single, intuitive platform. By gamifying community help, we move from passive alerts to active community protection.

### 🏆 Hackathon Experience:
Building this in 7 days for **HackOverflow** was an incredible experience. It pushed me to think about scalability, real-world utility, and clean UI/UX under tight deadlines.

Special thanks to the organizers at IIT Goa for this platform!
